Plugin Name: Processing js Easy
Plugin URI:
Description: Includes and executes graphical javascript applications that have been written with processing (.pde). HowTo: Upload your processing .pde files via ftp into the wp-content/uploads/ directory. You can also use .txt files and the media uploader, whatever you prefer. Use [processing]file_name.pde[/processing] in your page or post. If the browser can not show the content, the plugin provides the file as a download and a link to the processing website. Thanks to Ramoonus, who did the foundation for this. I did this plugin, because his direct text didn't work for me with the new Wordpress Version. The Version Number of this plugin will always be the same as the Processing JS Version.
Version: 1.4.1
